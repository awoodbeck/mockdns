# mockdns

Mock DNS server meant for use in debugging and testing software/devices interacting with DNS servers.

## TODO

* Add the ability to generate JSON by querying a domain name.  For example, querying "test.com" for "any" class and "all" types will spit out a JSON file that would allow mockdns to serve up the same DNS records.
